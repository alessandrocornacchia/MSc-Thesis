\ringraziamenti

Thanks to my relatives and my loved ones for their unceasing support throughout my academic career. All of them had a fundamental role in giving me always new motivations to overcome step by step the tough obstacles I dealt with. Particularly, thanks to my parents who leave me the possibility of pursuing my studies. I hope to reward their sacrifices.
Wide appreciation has to be granted to Politecnico di Torino and its personnel for the excellent teaching quality and the outstanding organization of its services. \\ 
Finally, special acknowledgments go to German Sviridov, for his contributions of paramount importance.
