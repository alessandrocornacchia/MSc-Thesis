I'd like first to thanks my supervisors for guiding me in the research process we conducted. I admire their critical view and I aspire to get the same predisposition to produce brilliant ideas.\\
Then, thanks to my relatives and my loved ones for their unceasing support throughout my academic career. All of them had a fundamental role in giving me always new motivations to overcome step by step the tough obstacles I dealt with. Particularly, thanks to my parents who gave me the possibility of pursuing my studies and whose sacrifices I hope to reward.\\
Wide appreciation has to be granted to Politecnico di Torino and its personnel for the excellent teaching quality and the outstanding organization of its services. \\ 
Finally, special acknowledgments go to German Sviridov, for his contributions of paramount importance.
