\ringraziamenti
I cannot begin to express my gratitude to my supervisors, who guided me all along this research process. Thanks to Andrea Bianco and Paolo Giaccone for the constructive criticism and passionate attitude toward my work. I admire their critical view and I aspire to get the same predisposition to produce brilliant ideas. I wish to extend my thanks to my relatives and my loved ones for their unceasing support throughout my academic career. Particularly, thanks to my parents who gave me the possibility of pursuing my studies and whose sacrifices I hope to reward.  They're settled commitment for my sake and their visible satisfaction in respect to my achievements had a fundamental role and supplied me always new motivations.
Wide appreciation has to be granted to Politecnico di Torino and its personnel for the excellent teaching quality and the outstanding organization of its services. Finally, special acknowledgments go to German Sviridov, whose contributions were of paramount importance.
